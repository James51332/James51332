### Hi there 👋

My name is James, and I am a rising freshman at UW-Madison 🦡 studying Computer Science! I am also proud to be a 2024 Amazon Future Engineer! 

Here are some projects that I've worked on in the past:

* 🌊 [OceanSimulation](https://James51332) - A realistic, physically based FFT Ocean Water simulation
* 👁️ [Vision](https://github.com/James51332/Vision) - A powerful 3D and 2D rendering and compute engine supporting both Metal and OpenGL
* ✍️ [dadabo.dev](https://dadabo.dev) - A personal blog where I write about the technical challenges I face on my projects
* 📗 [Lettermorph](https://github.com/James51332/Lettermorph) - A word themed game that earned 10th place in FBLA Nationals 2023
* 📈 [graphiti](https://github.com/James51332/graphiti) - A graphing calculator built using javascript as my final project for AP Computer Science Principles.

I am passionate about 3D rendering, and my favorite language to work with is C++!
